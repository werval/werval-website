## Build process

All content in `/doc` is static and generated by the build system.
A Gradle plugin hosted in the `buildSrc` directory does the job.

Generated documentations are also packaged as archives and are part of published artifacts using classifiers.

The build always generate `/doc/develop` using the QiWeb version `0 ` and reuse artifacts from previously released
versions of itself for `/doc/current` and `/doc/:version`.

First, core and modules documentations are extracted, a module index gets generated.
Next, the whole documentation gets SiteMeshed offline.
Finally, the generated sources are registered as project resources.
The `DocDevelopTask` does the whole job.
