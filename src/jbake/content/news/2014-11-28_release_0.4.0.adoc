After almost two years of development driven by usage in various applications put to production, we are pleased to
announce the immediate availability of Werval 0.4.

Werval is an open source JVM based toolkit for building HTTP services.
A lightweight core, live reload dev mode, useful modules, plugins for several build tools and
multiple languages support leave you free to choose the right architecture for your domain.

After stabilizing the core, this version was baked with usability and ease of adoption in mind.
